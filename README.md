This program allows a group of players of the game Catan to rank the five resources in terms of how much they individually value them at any given time during a game, and displays a graph showing the trends that each resource has followed.  

How to use:
Navigate to the server site on a computer or tablet to be used as a display.  It will generate a unique 4 digit code.  Each user then navigates to the client site from their mobile device.  They then enter this 4 digit code to join the room.  The players then get the ablity to drag and order the list of resources on their own device.  Every 30 seconds, the server pulls from the players' preferences to display the changes on a line graph on the display.  This probides the players with something that can both guide discussion and navigation as well as an artifact to examine at the end of a game to see the progression of different resources and their values changes over time.
